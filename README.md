Welcome to a OpenTelemetry Certified Associate (OTCA) Study Guide!

This repository is collection of my notes and resources that helped me learn and
prepare for the OpenTelemetry Certified Associate exam. The goal of this study
guide is to provide a comprehensive and easy-to-follow resource for anyone
preparing for the exam. The content is structured to cover all the key topics
outlined in the [OpenTelemetry Certified Associate exam syllabus](https://www.cncf.io/training/certification/otca/).

The study guide is built using [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/), a static
 site site generator powered by Vite. VitePress is designed for writing
documentation and is optimized for performance, making it a great choice for
creating a study guide like this one.
